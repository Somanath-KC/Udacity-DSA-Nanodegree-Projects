# Problem - 6

Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
In this problem, we will look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.


## Design Choices

* Used Linear Search to find min & max elements in unsorted array.

## Efficiency

The overall time complexity for this problem is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).

### Time Complexity

Since the algorithms traverses through every element of the input list the time complexity is in linear order, which is O(n)
	
### Space Complexity

The Spce complexity of this problem is O(1) The variable assignments is done only once through out the algorithm.
